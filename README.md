## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.
